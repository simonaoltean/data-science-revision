    "## Exercise 1: Line of Best Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "In school, you probably worked with scatterplots and drew lines of best fit on the data that didn't deviate too far from the scatterpoints. By doing it this way, we would minimize the **Error** of the line of best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to choose the model that will generate the least errors when fitted to your data. This will ensure far more reliable outputs. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are many error functions to choose from when it comes to modelling data. In this exercise , we will look at *Ordinary Least Squares*. As you can see in the picture, the vertical distance from the line of best fit to our data point is called the error. If we square the errors and take an average of the errors, we have obtained the **Mean Square Error (MSE)** for the model.\n",
